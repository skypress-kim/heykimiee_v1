                        there is no room for error.&nbsp; Picture this:&nbsp; After a long day at work, finally home for the evening and all you'd like to do is relax with a glass of wine and watch your guilty pleasure tv shows or finish the next chapter
                        in your current read.&nbsp; Well not so fast, have you forgotten you have a bachelorette party to plan in a city you've never visited?! Set your DVR to record, keep your mark in that book, and grab that glass of wine because you
                        will need it to get your through the many, many websites you will be perusing through to make this a memorable trip for everyone.&nbsp; You can take that stressful route, or you can trust me to do all the work!!&nbsp; After answering
                        a few questions during a quick discussion with "yours truly”, you can get back to your quiet evenings of relaxing after a long day at work! We will choose everything from accommodations and daily activities, to dinners and night
                        life; after we have decided what will best suit the entire party, I will get to planning. It's that simple! <br><br>My passion for joining in on the bachelorette fun stems from a fun adventure that occurred during my first month
                        in this amazing city. I was out on Rainey with friends and saw three girls decorated with the classic bachelorette accessories, quietly sitting in deep conversation. I thought to myself, "These girls need some (fun/sassiness) in
                        their lives!" After approaching them, getting a conversation going, and a round of shots - they were having the party they planned for.&nbsp; We exchanged fun stories, had lots of laughs and the ladies made a few new friends.&nbsp;
                        We also swapped numbers, and the following night I picked them up from the W Hotel and we hopped around West 6 street, the hip down town place to be. They were awesome to let me join in on the fun, and they we thrilled I took the
                        time to show them around town. (insert 1st bachelorette party picture)<br><br>Fast forward 3 years and I have explored Austin in all its glory! There are fun day events and the night life is even better. The city offers foodies
                        a delicious experience in casual and fine dining, and the food trucks are one of a kind.&nbsp; Daily adventures range from boat parties, paddle boarding, and party bike rides.&nbsp; Night life is fast paced and exciting; you can
                        parade the party down West 6th street or take a different route to the historic "Dirty" 6th Street or the always fun Rainey Street.&nbsp; No matter where this bachelorette weekend takes you trust that the "Sassy" experience is
                        the way to go!</p>
